                    <p>I believe that all software, from small scripts to enterprise level servers, should be <em>crafted</em>. No, most pieces of software don't need a 30+ page requirements document. However, software is a solution to a problem. As such, I believe it important to put in enough effort to <em>deliberately</em> solve the problem.</p>
                    <p>In all my years of developing software, I've never once seen a little thought do anything but improve software.</p>
                    <p>"Hack it till it works", doesn't.</p>
